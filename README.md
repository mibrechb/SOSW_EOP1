The Earth Observation Prototype 1 (EOP1) for Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) retrieval is a prototype algorithm designed to estimate suspended sediment concentrations in lakes and rivers using Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-7/8/9 ETM+/OLI/OLI-2 data. This prototype addresses data gaps related to sediment flows, particularly in the Mekong basin, which are critical for maintaining ecosystem health and delta stability. The model offers high-resolution (10 to 30 meters) mapping capabilities and supports both monitoring applications and historical analysis dating back to April 1999. 

This repository is part of the Deliverable 3.2 of SOS-Water - Water Resources System Safe Operating Space in a Changing Climate and Society ([DOI:10.3030/101059264](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101059264)). Other code contributions to D3.2 can be found at the [SOS-Water - WP3 Earth Observation repository](https://github.com/mibrechb/SOSW_WP3).
